# WordPress Meetups Widget

The WordPress Meetups Widget allows you to show meetups based on a specified location and timezone. Based on the WordPress Widget Boilerplate by [Tom McFarlin](https://twitter.com/tommcfarlin/) and the built-in Events widget on the WordPress dashboard.

## Features

* The Widget shows a list of official WordPress events with relevant information for each.
* Allows the site admin to choose what location to show events from.
* Options include showing past events or not (when available) and limiting by date or number of events.

## Usage

The WordPress Meetup Widget Boilerplate is ready to activate as-is (and it includes a sample widget with a title, content, and checkbox).

1. Copy the `wordpress-meetups-widget` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Navigate to the "Plugins" dashboard page
3. Locate the menu item that reads "TODO"
4. Click on "Activate"

The purpose of having a working widget is to give you an idea as to where certain things belong. Further, the idea is to fork the existing code and make it your own for your own project.

It's organized in such a way that lends itself to unit testing, a higher level of cohesion, a lower level of coupling. It also uses features of the object-oriented paradigm to provide better organization of code base and features of PHP such as namespaces and type hinting.
